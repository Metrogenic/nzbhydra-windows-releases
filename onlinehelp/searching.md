## Indexer access
By default if access to an indexer fails the indexer is disabled for a certain amount of time (for a short while first, then increasingly longer if the problems persist). You can select to disable this and always try these indexers.

Some indexers provide information if a release is passworded. If you select to ignore these releases only those will be ignored of which I know for sure that they're actually passworded.

Raw search engines like Binsearch don't support searches based on IDs (e.g. for a movie using an IMDB id). You can enable query generation for these. Hydra will then try to retrieve the movie's or show's title and generate a query, for example "showname s01e01".
 
Some indexers don't seem to like Hydra and disable access based on the user agent. You can change it here if you want. Please leave it as it is if you have no problems. This allows indexers to gather better statistics on how their API services are used.

### Forbidden and required words
You can provide a list of forbidden and required words. These will be applied to every search, internal or external. One forbidden word in a result title dismisses the result. If none of the required words is found anywhere in a result title it's also dismissed. You can define forbidden and required words for categories in the next tab.
Usually required or forbidden words are applied on a word base, so they must word a complete word in a title. Only they contain a dash or a dot they may appear anywhere in the title. Example:
"ea" matches "something.from.ea" but not "release.from.other". "web-dl" matches "title.web-dl" and "someweb-dl".

## Result processing
If you have LXML installed for python select it for faster parsing of results from indexers like Binsearch or NZB Club.

Hydra tries to find duplicate results from different indexers using heuristics. You can control some parameters for that but usually the default values work quite well. 
You can decide if you want to remove found duplicates from API search results or leave that to the tool. Usually tools do not expect to find duplicates in search results so you should leave this enabled.
 
NZB downloads from Hydra can either be achieved by redirecting the requester to the original indexer or by downloading the NZB from the indexer and serving this.
Redirecting has the advantage that it causes the least load on Hydra but also the disadvantage that the requester might be forwarded to an indexer link that contains the indexer's API key. To prevent that select to proxy NZBs.
