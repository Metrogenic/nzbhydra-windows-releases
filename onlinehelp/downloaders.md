You can add one to many NZB downloaders that you want to be able to send NZBs to from the search results. Currenlty SABnzbd and NZBGet are supported.

"NZB access type" is the same one as in the searching tab, only that it affects the downloads from the indexer.

You can select if you want to upload the NZB to the downloader or send a Hydra link. The downloader will do the download itself. This is a matter of taste, but adding a link and redirecting the downloader is the fastest way.
 
If you have multiple downloaders of the same type you can select an icon from the [Font Awesome library](http://fontawesome.io/examples/). This icon will be shown in the search results and the NZB download history instead of the default downloader icon.
