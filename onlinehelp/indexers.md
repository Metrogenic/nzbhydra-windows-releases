Hydra comes with a list of preconfigured search engines (like NZB Club and Binsearch for raw searches and Womble's index for TV releases)

Most of you will want to use your newznab indexers here. The first time an indexer is added the connection is tested. When successful the supported search IDs and types are checked. These determine if indexers allow searching for movies, shows or ebooks using meta data like the IMDB id or the author and title.
